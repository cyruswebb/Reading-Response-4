    <h1>Reading Response 3: Critical Design</h1>
    <h2>"Design is the Rendering of Intent"</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Web design is all based around intent. If your intent is to design a simple website, then the website you construct will likely reflect that simplicity. If your intent is to design a complex website, then the website you construct will likely reflect that complexity.</li>
        <li>The CBP’s Global entry site is a poorly designed website, and not the most accessible of sites, because the designers of the site were merely focusing on getting the site up and running as quickly as possible. Their intent was to rapidly design a website, and that intent is thus seen in the poor design of the website. </li>
        <li>Contrarily, the We The People online petition site, also designed by the government, is a very effectively designed and streamlined website because the designers of the site wanted to create a simple yet accessible website that encouraged citizen participation. Their intent was to create a structurally sound and accessible website, and their good intentions can be seen in the success of the design of the website. </li>
        <li>Even if an idea is incredible and successfully rendered, the design of a particular idea can be rendered improperly. For example, the idea of the Global Entry Site is great, but the rendering of the website is not so great.</li>
        <li>Approach is of the utmost importance when designing a website. If you approach the design of a website from the perspective of the user, than the rendering of the website design will be much more fluid.</li>
        <li>It can be good to have a wide range of designers with different backgrounds when rendering a website as it allows for the site to be more well-rounded.</li>
        <li>It is very important to first agree upon the single main intention of a website in order to make sure you are rendering the design of the website to fit that particular intention. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Quote of Importance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Both the Global Entry and We The People were designed by teams of government employees. Both teams wanted their constituents to engage successfully with the design. Yet the two designs approach that in a very different way."</li>
    </ul>
<h2>"Reading Critical Designs"</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What is Critical Design? Well, Dunne and Raby say that critical design, "rejects how things are now as being the only possibility, it provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values" (1951).</li>
        <li>It is still very tough to know whether one has effectively employed the use of critical design because there is not very much information on what goes into an effective rendering of critical design. </li>
        <li>The main way to evaluate critical design is to examine how effectively designers are able to critically analyze or explain a very layered concept.</li>
        <li>The idea of critical design goes hand in hand with art because, "as with art, the social function of critical design is characterized as engendering debates and changing perspectives about important social issues." Art and critical design are both different methods that attempt to bring about social change through detailed critical analysis of the world. However, the big difference between art and critical design fields is that the field of critical design currently seems to lack the structure found in the world of art.</li>
        <li>How do you effectively read critical designs? The awnser is quite simple and can be brokedn down into three main steps. First it is necessary to, "Identify a unit of analysis to work from" (1954). You have to narrow down what portion of a critical design you are going to be looking at. Are you going to be analyzing merely one part of a whole critical design, the entire critical design itself, of a collection of whole critical designs? Secondly you want to, "Situate that unit of analysis in relation to extant conventions and norms" (1954). Basically this means that we must have an understanding or knowledge of the larger critical aspect that we are examining. If we are looking at music as a whole, we need to know what kind of music we are looking at compared to the hundreds of music genres out there. We need to know where our particular “unit of analysis” compares to the whole. Lastly you want to, "Isolate the critical aspects of the design as a focus of thought and attention" (1954). In this last area, the goal is to narrow our focus further, looking exclusively at critical design and the effect that it has.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Quote of Importance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Critical judgments about designs are frequently generative that is, they help designers think in new ways, imagine alternative futures, frame design problems in new ways, and consider new material possibilities" (1953-1954).</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Four Major Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the number one factor that would lead to a critical design being constituted as "good"?</li>
        <li>What does the future of critical design analysis look like? Will it become more of a bonafide field similar to literary analysis or movie criticism?</li>
        <li>Can their be critical design analysis for something like a podcast? Or is critical design analysis reserved solely for visual fields such as websites?</li>
        <li>How important is intent in the rendering of a critically designed website? Can you ahve poor intent and accidentally render a smartly designed website?</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Critical Design: Project Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For my project I am considering creating a podcast, which looks at the VT shaped student. In particular, I would like to focus on the community service factor of the VT shaped student and analyze the role that Ut Prosim plays in the development of a writer. To go about doing this, I am thinking about providing several critical real-life examples which show the intersection between writing and personal experiences. I would also like to look at the various different career paths that a writer can follow, nonfiction, fiction, science fiction, etc. and the role that community service and involvement plays in the development of a writer’s world view. Once again, I would like to go about doing this by analyzing the intersection between one’s interactions with the community and their writing interests. Also, if I have the time, I would like to look at editing the VT shaped student to include a greater focus on mentorship. I would go about doing this, by critically reflecting on the power of communication between individuals with similar interests but very different worldviews. Essentially, I would like to focus on critically analyzing and talking about the intersection between real world events and experiences and how it effects one's development as a writer. I want the listener to better grasp how what one does outside of the classroom is just as important to their development as a writer during their time as a college student.</li>
